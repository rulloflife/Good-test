	<p>Even though modern websites are generally built with user-friendly interfaces. it's useful to <br> know some basic HTML. If you know the following 17 HTML example tags (and a few <br> extras), you'll be albe to create a basic webpage from scratch or tweak the code created by <br> an app like WordPress.</p>
	<p>We've provided HTML code examples with output for most of the tags. If you want to see <br> them in action, download the sample HTML file at the end of the articlel. You can play with <br> it in a text editor and load it up in a browser to see what your changes do.</p>
	<h1>1.< !DOCTYPE html ></h1>
	<hr>
	<p>You'll need this tag at the beginning of every HTML document you create. It ensures that a <br> browser knows that it's reading HTML,and that it expects HTML5, the latest version.</p>
	<p>Even though this isn't actually an HTML tag, it's still a good one to know.</p>
	<h1>2.< html ></h1>
	<hr>
	<p>This is another tag that tells a browser that it's reading HTML. The < html > tag goes <br> straight after the DOCTYPE tag, and you close it with a < /html > tag right at the end of your <br> file. Everything else in your document goes between these tags.</p>
